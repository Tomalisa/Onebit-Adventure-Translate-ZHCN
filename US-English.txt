    "I got 2 kids to feed and a home to go to! Come on. Help a brother out.",

    "So how's your adventure going?",
    "*Smacks lips* I was going to ask him that! You're always pretending to be the nice one.",
    "Thats too bad. At least you still have your sanity. Not many can continue their adventures the way you have.",

    "Well next time, try to eat more than one Steak when fighting a Ghoul who clearly does more damage than you think!",
    "So how's your adventure going?",
    "Why are you so nosy? We're all having a great time slaying the Slimes and Casters faster than a Ghoul's wakeup call.",

    "Wait, you find food on the ground and eat it? That seems unsanitary and a safety hazard where I'm from!",

    "Wait, what's that!? Dark Matter??? It's what the Wraith uses to harness dark energy although a small amount of it.",
    "The power to be eternal in the palm of your hands. Ha ha! Now that's something very powerful... Am I right?",
    "Using Dark Matter... That's impossible...",

    "Hahaha! YES! After all this time! I've finally done it!",
    "I was cursed... only allowed to touch Dark Matter if it were handed to me in a peaceful transaction of only 1 coin. You, have allowed this.",
    "No matter! Now that I can harness this dark energy, resetting the world will be no challenge... So long adventurer!",
    "It was nice knowing you... Don't worry though. I will still be around to give you items, just know that in the end, this world is mine.",
